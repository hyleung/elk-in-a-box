#ELK-in-a-Box

##What is this?
[ELK stack](http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/) (ElasticSearch, LogStash, Kibana) - containerized. 

Uses Docker and Fig to build and run a local ELK stack that can be used to aggregate and process logs in your local development environment.

It is **not** intended to be, by any stretch of the imagination, used to monitor your logs in production.

##Prereqs

You'll need:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com) or [Boot2docker](http://boot2docker.io) if you're on OSX or Windows (tho' I haven't actually tried running this on Windows) - see notes below for some workarounds
- [Fig](http:www.fig.sh) to build and run the stack

##Getting Started

###Building the images

`fig build`

###Running 

`fig up`

###Stopping

`fig stop`

###Removing the stopped containers

`fig rm`

â€¦in other words, your regular [fig commands](http://www.fig.sh/cli.html)

##ElasticSearch

ElasticSearch is exposed on ports 9200 and 9300. The Docker image is built with CORS enabled.

##Logstash

You'll find the configuration file for Logstash in `conf`. By default, Fig will mount this directory into the Logstash container into `/etc/conf`. The provided `logstash.conf` will consume any log files in `/var/logs`, which Fig will mount the local `logs` directory into. 

At the moment, the idea is that you'd symlink any logs or log directories into this folder and update your `logstash.conf` accordingly. 

##Kibana

Once the everything is up and running, you should be able to find [Kibana](http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/kibana/) at [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) or, if you're using boot2docker, the IP of the Boot2Docker VM - for example [http://192.168.59.103:8888](http://192.168.59.103:8888).

##Boot2docker tips/workarounds

- You'll probabably need to be running boot2docker 1.3 minimum - at least on OSX, since shared directories actually work the way you'd [expect them to work](https://blog.docker.com/2014/10/docker-1-3-signed-images-process-injection-security-options-mac-shared-directories/).    
- Currently, Fig seems to have problems verifying the cert(?) - if you add an entry into your `/etc/hosts` file to add entry to resolve `boot2docker` to your boot2docker ip (i.e. `boot2docker ip`), it seems to make Fig happy
